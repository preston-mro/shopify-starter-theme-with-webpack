# Shopify Starter Theme with Webpack
12/14/2021 - Initial Setup  
This is a bare bones minimal Shopify starter theme. It comes with a basic Webpack setup and a custom CSS Framework.
Webpack will transpile Sass to CSS and bundle Javascript files. The CSS framework comes with a 16-column grid and a bunch of utility classes.

This will never be a complete Shopify theme. That's not the goal. The goal is to provide a boilerplate for quickly getting you to the point where you can start developing with minimal config. I plan on adding to it but I don't have much free time right now, so I don't know when that will be. Do you remember the old Slate theme? Well, this one has even less stuff- it's a blank slate! * *drum shots* *

It's preferable that this is used by developers already familiar with Webpack and Shopify because I don't have time to write up proper documentation.

I also want to mention that this was my first time setting up Webpack so there might be mistakes or room for improvement. As of today it's all working as expected though.

If you want to help me with this project I totally welcome that. I can't promise that I will accept all PRs because I am going to be a little picky about this project. And if you fork this please give me credit.
